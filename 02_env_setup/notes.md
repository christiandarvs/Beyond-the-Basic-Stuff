## Absolute vs Relative Paths
- **Absolute**: always begins with the root folder
- **Relative**: relative to the program's ``cwd``
- ``.\``- shorthand for "this directory"
- ``..\``- means "the parent folder"

-  Use double quotes around command line arguments with spaces, like folder and file names, to avoid confusion.
-  **Move Files/Folders**: ``mv [source file/folder] [destination folder]``
-  **Rename Files/Folders**: ``ren [source file/folder] [new name]``
-  **Make Folders**: ``mkdir [new folder]``
